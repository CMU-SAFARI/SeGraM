# SeGraM (Software implementation and the datasets will be available soon!)

SeGraM is a universal genomic mapping accelerator that supports both sequence-to-graph mapping and sequence-to sequence mapping, for both short and long reads. SeGraM consists of two main components: (1) MinSeed, the first minimizer-based seeding accelerator, which finds the candidate mapping locations (i.e., subgraphs) in a given genome graph; and (2) BitAlign, the first bitvector-based sequence-to-graph alignment accelerator, which performs alignment between a given read and the subgraph identified by MinSeed. MinSeed is built upon a memory-efficient minimizer-based seeding algorithm, and BitAlign is built upon our novel bitvector-based, highly-parallel sequence-to-graph alignment algorithm. 

In MinSeed, the minimizer-based seeding approach decreases the memory footprint of the index and provides speedup during seed queries. MinSeed logic requires only basic operations (e.g., comparisons, simple arithmetic operations, scratchpad read-write operations) that are implemented with simple logic. Due to frequent memory accesses required for fetching the seeds, we couple MinSeed with High-Bandwidth Memory (HBM) to enable low-latency and highly-parallel memory access, which alleviates the memory latency bottleneck. 

In BitAlign, we design a new bitvector-based alignment approach, which is amenable to efficient hardware acceleration. BitAlign employs a systolic-array-based design to circulate the internal data (i.e., bitvectors) generated by different processing elements, which provides scalability and reduces both memory bandwidth and memory footprint. In order to handle hops (i.e., non-neighbor nodes in the graph-based reference), BitAlign provides a simple design that contains queue structures between each processing element, which store the most recently generated bitvectors.
